Start with kepler_names.csv apply appropriate filters. The use the KOI Table to remove Lightcurve identifiers which have confirmed exoplanets or are candidates exoplanets. This the Non Exoplanet List.\n","\n","2. Obtain Raw Light Curve data for Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7 for atleast 2,000 lightcures from the Non-Exoplanet List\n","\n","3. Compute **Completeness Metric** for further filtration: determine the quantity of  observations as a percentage of the expected number for each quarter (which is approximately equal to the number of 29.4 minute intervals in 90 days, around 4416)\n","\n","4. Compute **Data Quality Metric** for further filtration: determine the amount of Hi quality observations as a percentage of all available observations, using the Quality indicator supplied by the Kepler Data Source, marking those curves with atleast 80% high quality observations.\n","\n","5.
